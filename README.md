# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard-Week-6-Challenge

## Description

The motivation behind this application was to create an Application that is able to check the current weather and weather for the next 5 days of a city within the United States. If I am traveling to a specific city, I am able to
easily type in the name of the city and the Weather Forecast APP will populate the current weather. A user is also
able to save the weather of multiple cities using local storage.

## Installation

No installation is required. User can navigate to Weather Forecast APP website and continue to using the application.

## Usage

Navigate to the homepage and type in a city name that is part of the United States. The current weather plus
the following four day forecast will populate.
