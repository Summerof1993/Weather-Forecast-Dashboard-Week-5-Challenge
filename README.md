# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard-Week-5-Challenge

## Description

The motivation behind this application was to create an Application that is able to check the current weather and weather for the next 5 days of a city within the United States. If I am traveling to a specific city, I am able to
easily type in the name of the city and the Weather Forecast APP will populate the current weather. A user is also
able to save the weather of multiple cities using local storage.

## Installation

No installation is required. User can navigate to Weather Forecast APP website and continue to using the application.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
